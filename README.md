## React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders as empty, even when data has been successfully fetched from an API. The issue is subtle and doesn't always occur, making it challenging to debug.

### Bug Description
The `DataList` component fetches data from a remote API. While the data fetch succeeds, the FlatList occasionally shows nothing, despite `data` containing valid data.

### Steps to Reproduce
The exact steps to reproduce the bug are not fully consistent. It appears to be related to race conditions or data handling within the asynchronous fetch process.

### Potential Causes
Possible causes include:

* **Asynchronous issues**:  Problems in how the fetched data is handled with `useState` and the asynchronous `useEffect` hook.
* **Data structure inconsistencies**: Unexpected data formatting from the API response.
* **React Native rendering lifecycle**:  Unforeseen timing in the rendering lifecycle of FlatList.

### Solution
See `DataListSolution.js` for a possible solution.  This solution addresses the asynchronous update problem by ensuring the `data` is properly updated before rendering and provides better error handling.
